          <li>
            You may cancel for free up to <strong>{cancel} hours</strong> before your

          <li>First-time colour clients are required to complete a 48h patch test before service. There is no charge for it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Shop orders</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Prices shown include VAT (where applicable) and are charged in the currency shown at checkout.</li>

        <h2>Gift cards</h2>
        <p>
          Gift cards are personal and cannot be exchanged for cash. The balance on a card

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these terms occasionally. The version at the top of this page

          These terms are governed by the laws of the country listed in our registered
